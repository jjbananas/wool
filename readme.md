# Wool - PHP in Sheep's Clothing

Wool is a PHP framework and base application intended for rapid construction of new projects. It is not currently in a releasable state, but many of the key features are in a reasonable condition.

I haven't worked on it for a few years now, since I stopped writing PHP in my day job. But there are enough interesting features contained here that I'm open sourcing the code by popular demand from my friends.

**Do not expect to be able to run the code without modification.**
